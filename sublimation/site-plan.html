      <h3>Main Services</h3>
      <p>
        Screen printing: Also known as silk screening, screen printing is a manual process of creating a 
        custom cloth. It uses a silk-screen that is placed over the t-shirt. Brightly colored ink 
        is then dragged across the t-shirt to create the design. It requires a fair amount of skill to perform, 
        and results are best when performed by a professional. We not only have the experience and know-how, 
        but specialized equipment that enables us to turn out a huge batch of custom clothes that will look amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a great option for companies who need to produce promotional merchandise or personalized workwear with their exact brand colors.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Embroidery: is essentially defined as a method of adorning fabric with the use of a
        thread and needle. Embroidery requires a high quality and thicker garment, such as a hoodie, 
        polo or sweatshirt. This is because a thinner garment could pull the fabric 
        when attempted to embroider. Typical use of embroidery is for logos or smaller designs. Many businesses 
        choose embroidery in their uniforms. This is because embroidery looks professional 
        and gives the garment a more solid feel. Embroidery is long lasting and will not fade in 
        the wash. For this reason, some argue that embroidery is a lot more cost effective 
        than printing. Embroidery should be used on uniforms and garments that are designed to be long lasting.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sublimation:
        This is a great process that allows for vibrant, full color, all-over prints that are exceptionally 
        durable. Naturally the magic of the process lies in the printing technology. With designs infused 
        directly onto the fabric, they become a part of the fabric itself. All of the design elements 
        including the team logo, colors, and numbers become a part of the fabric in sublimation. So, there is no 
        scope for the colors or logos to peel off or fade in sublimated sports teams.

      <h3>Sewing</h3>
      <p>
        When a company wants more than all of our main options, we offer our service of sewing.
        Sometimes organizations like schools, universities, 
        sport teams and companies have only a design of their logo, 
        but they do not know how their uniform can be. Based on a 
        logo we can sew a custom uniform. All uniforms are going to be different 
        for each company, because all the logos are different and unique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, when it comes to creating uniforms for marching bands we offer the service of sewing as well.
        Uniforms for marching bands require more work and process, 
        but we are willing to provide the best service. Even when a 
        marching band does not bring a custom design or idea for a uniform, 
        with the colors of the band it is possible to create something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a committed company, we want to make sure that you are more than 
        welcome to ask about all of our services. No matter whether you want to wear casual or formal, 
        you can get your personal design or logo on your clothes. Any organization and 
        person can create a new fashion because everyone is a unique human being, 
        and our imagination is beyond our understanding.
