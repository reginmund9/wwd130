    <p>Hello everybody. I am from Bolivia, but I am living in Costa Rica right now. Here rains a lot, but it has beautiful landscapes.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was 14 years old. 
       Everything in this church is wonderful like the temples and programs like BYU-Pathway Wordlwide.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am single and I work in a newspaper company. 
        I am pursuing a bachelor degree in software development. Computer science is changing many things like artificial intelligence, and 
        I want to be part of this change in a positive way.</p>
